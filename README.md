# Microsoft Graph API PHP Adapter
Based on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/tutorials/php-app-only

## A note on API library version
The documentation is rather sparse and many of the examples utilize
the new (not yet production ready) Kiota-generated API libraries,
so they are not very useful with the current stable (April 2023)
API library.

## Environment setup
Copy `env.example` to `.env` and edit as required.

## Run examples
```shell
php examples/list-users.php
```
